# Post-Epicodus Goals

#### This is an independent project exploring 20 objectives to keep you motivated and constantly learning after I graduate from Epicodus, 12.01.2017

#### By Riki Montgomery

### High Priority Goals

* Ship a minimum viable product for my portfolio website by the end of Christmas break.

* Continue expanding on my Capstone Project and present at the Epicodus Demo Day in February.

* Apply to at least 3 jobs and have lunch with at least one new LinkedIn or meetup connection every week.

* Finish the *Dissecting Ruby on Rails 5* Udemy course I started.

* Continue volunteering at Free Geek or give my time to mentoring new developers through another non-profit.

### Medium Priority Goals

* Practice whiteboarding and solve at least 3 [codewars](https://www.codewars.com/) problems a week using JavaScript.

* Finish reading *Learning JavaScript* by Ethan Brown.

* Finsh all of the lessons at [www.freecodecamp.org](https://www.freecodecamp.org/)

* Attend at least 5 meetups a month, including Portland Javascript Admireres, Ruby Brigade, Full Stack PDX, New Tech PDX, and Mentorship Saturdays.

* Finish reading *The Well-Grounded Rubyist* by David A. Black.

### Low Priority Goals

* Design and print business cards for the Epicodus Demo Day in February.

* Improve my understanding of the map and reduce methods in JavaScript.

* Write LinkedIn recommendations for my classmates and former coworkers.

* Finish reading *Practical Object-Oriented Design in Ruby: An Agile Primer* by Sandi Metz

* Read the *Bastards Book of Ruby*.

### No Priority Goals

* Start a blog for my portfolio website and begin journaling my experiences in tech. Write my first article about my time at Epicodus.

* Start the Welcome to React 16 - The Complete Guide (incl. React Router 4 & Redux).

* Build my own gaming computer.

* Build my own home network.

* Continue to plan regular hiking and backpacking trips with my friends in order to keep my sanity.

### Top 3 Goals

1. Shipping an MVP portfolio site in time for the new year is a priority, because it would serve as a very important reference for the recruiters and connections I meet during my job hunt.

2. Continuing to expand on my capstone after week 5 of Rails will be vital to my success at Demo Day and give me a great project to demonstrate to potential employers.

3. I need to be applying for jobs as often as I can. Differentiating myself with lofty projects and a fancy LinkedIn bio won't mean squat if I am not getting myself out there in person and on paper.

### Summary

My plan of action starts with building an MVP for my portfolio website by Christmas, continuing to apply for jobs, and expanding my capstone, or a similar project, beyond the Epicodus classroom. The most important thing is continuing to utilize the skills I have learned in new and interesting ways, while also deepening my understanding and meeting like-minded people along my journey.
